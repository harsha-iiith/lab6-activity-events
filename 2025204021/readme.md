Interactive Task List

Hey there! This is a simple task management app I built for my Software System Development class. It's all about managing your daily tasks with a clean, drag-and-drop interface.

What It Does

This app lets you:
- Add new tasks by typing them in and hitting "Add Task"
- Remove tasks by clicking the red "Remove" button
- Reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them around
- Works great on both desktop and mobile devices

How to Use It

1. Open the app: Just open index.html in any web browser
2. Add a task: Type your task in the input box and click "Add Task"
3. Remove a task: Click the red "Remove" button next to any task
4. Reorder tasks: Click and drag any task to move it up or down in the list

That's it! Super straightforward.
